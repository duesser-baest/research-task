Algorithm 1 Decision Tree Creation
1: procedure BUILD_TREE(training set partition 𝑝)
2: generate new node (n)
3: if stop criterion reached then
4: return
5: identify best split of feature and feature value
6: partition 𝑝 according to split decision into (𝑝1, 𝑝2)
7: for all 𝑝𝑖 do
8: BUILD_TREE(𝑝𝑖)

TODO

implement build tree to keep partitioning space 
implement stoping criteria (1) min_leafe_size, (2) max_tree_depth
implement pruining dependent on alpha
implement different loss measures
implement looking forward
	find_split function:
		dont just return best split, but rather sorted list of splits


##############
if spliting list is empty -> return
